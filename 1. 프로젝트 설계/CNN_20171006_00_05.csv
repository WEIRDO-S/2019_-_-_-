Some energy bars contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar

(CNN) Energy bars are a convenient source of nutrition and come in a wide variety of flavors to satisfy different palates. They are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, which can help fill nutritional gaps.

But, like many foods in a specific category, not all energy bars are created equal. Those that are low in saturated fat and sugars, with a decent amount of protein and fiber, can provide a nutritious, satisfying pick-me-up. Others can closely mimic a candy bar. For example, some bars covered in chocolate contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar; others contain almost as much sugar.

Granola bars are a convenient source of nutrition, but can vary significantly in terms of nutrition.

Energy bars containing mostly fruit and nuts can serve as satisfying snacks. But if you're looking for a meal replacement, aim for a bar with a higher amount of protein: about 10 to 20 grams. Athletes can also benefit from choosing a bar with more protein and carbohydrates, as their needs are higher.

You can afford more calories if bars are consumed in place of meals and not as snacks. But if a bar is intended only to tide you over until dinner, limit it to 150 to 200 calories.

In general, try to aim for bars with less than 3 grams of saturated fat and at least 4 grams of fiber. Palm kernel oil in yogurt and chocolate coatings will boost saturated fat. Also watch out for bars with ingredients such as brown rice syrup or cane invert syrup listed first, as they are generally higher in sugars than others and are better suited for athletes, not weight watchers.

The official trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi debuted during halftime of the Monday night match up between the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings.

The new trailer gives us our latest look at the most anticipated film of the year, which brings us back to the galaxy far, far away.

It focused on the two new main characters of the series in Adam Driver's Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley's Rey as well as old favorites like Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia.

I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then, Skywalker says as shots of Rey using the Force are shown. It does now.

The trailer also includes shots of battles taking place on new planets and in space, and ends with the evil Ren seemingly reaching out his hand to Rey.

I need someone to show me my place in all this, Rey says as the trailer closes.

The trailer garnered a big reaction on social media and racked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube in roughly 30 minutes.

Tickets to Last Jedi went on sale following the trailer's debut, leaving fans scrambling to nab a ticket to the film -- which opens on December 15.

Before the trailer's premiere, Disney released a new poster for the film. The print had a red hue and included characters like Rey wielding a blue lightsaber as well as a bearded Skywalker shrouded in a black hood in the center.

Last Jedi is the eighth episode in the Star Wars saga and is a direct sequel to the 2015 blockbuster, Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

It stars Ridley, John Boyega and Hamill. It is also the last film role of Fisher, who died last year.

Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise from creator George Lucas in 2012 for $4 billion.

The company has already seen a windfall at the box office with Force Awakens bringing in more than $2 billion worldwide and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the franchise's first spinoff, which made more than $1 billion.",Star Wars: The Last Jedi' trailer debuts on 'Monday Night Football',http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/09/media/star-wars-the-last-jedi-trailer/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,

Carles Puigdemont, the President of Catalonia, was due to address a specially convened session of the region's parliament. But the session, due to begin at 12 p.m. ET (6p.m. local time) was delayed amid reports of international mediation to end the crisis.

Puigdemont requested the delay given the contacts for an international mediation, his spokesman Joan Maria Pique told CNN. He did not immediately provide additional details on the mediation.

The anti-independence Ciutadans party and the Catalan branch of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party (PPC) had also requested a suspension of Tuesday' rsession, according to a document seen by CNN.

Puigdemont was under intense pressure to back down from plans to declare independence from Spain following a disputed referendum.

The Parc de la Ciutadella, which houses the Catalan parliament building, was sealed off to the public for safety reasons, with the Catalan police Mossos guarding the entrances and exits.

National police and the Guardia Civil kept a low profile, according to CNN reporters.

Officers of Catalonia's regional police force stand guard outside the Parliament of Catalonia.

European Council President Donald Tusk urged Puigdemont to back down. The force of arguments is always better than the argument of force, he said in Brussels.

Today I ask you to respect in your attentions the constitutional order and not announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible, he said. Diversity should not lead to conflict whose consequences would be bad for Catalonia, Spain and the whole of Europe.

Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau, an influential figure who has been critical of both sides, called for de-escalation. She urged Puigdemont not to make a unilateral declaration of independence, and also called on the government of Prime Minister Rajoy not to impose direct rule from Madrid. Now is the time for dialogue, she said in address from in Barcelona.

Barcelona mayor Ada Colau delivers a speech at the City Council in Barcelona.

Colau said Spain was experiencing its worst institutional crisis since democracy began and said Spain's political elected representatives should find a solution that is inclusive and up to standards we have been living.

Neighboring France said Monday it would not recognize an independent Catalonia -- and independence would result in automatic expulsion from the European Union.

Political uncertainty

However thousands of supporters of independence are expected to show up at the parliament in Barcelona to show support for the plan, and to call on Puigdemont to honor his commitments to the separatist movement.

The political uncertainty began with a divisive and controversial referendum on October 1 that found a majority of Catalan voters in favor of independence for the wealthy, northeastern region of Spain.

Madrid declared the referendum illegal and Spanish police tried to shut the vote down by firing rubber bullets and pulling voters from polling booths in scenes that shocked many across Europe.

Catalonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Raul Romeva Rueda, told CNN's Nima Elbagir that the Catalan side has long wanted to negotiate a fair bargain with the Spanish state.

What we have always demanded is a political dialogue. The opportunity to (practice) democracy, to allow everybody to express themselves ... We want to talk, we need to negotiate. The problem is nobody's listening from the Spanish state side.

He said that the Catalan government has invited international mediation and called for dialogue.

We say, 'we are ready, we want to go to the negotiating table. We are ready to start talks' ... If (the central government has) an offer to make we are very much keen to listen to them.

PM: 'Spain will not be divided'

Prime Minister Rajoy is determined to prevent a breakaway by the northeastern province in the wake of the October 1 vote.

Spain will not be divided, and the national unity will be preserved. To this end we will employ all the means we have within the law. It is up to the government to make decisions, and to do so at the right moment, Rajoy said in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt on Monday.

Catalan authorities said 90% of voters chose independence from Madrid, but the result was not as decisive as it appeared -- turnout was only 43%.

What's at stake?

The stakes are high for both Spain and Europe if Catalonia chooses to break away.

Catalonia accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain's economy, and leads all regions in producing 25% of the country's exports, CNNMoney reports. It contributes much more in taxes (21% of the country's total) than it gets back from the central government.

The prospect of an independent Catalonia has already prompted two major banks and some other businesses to move their registered headquarters to other parts of Spain.

There is more at stake for Madrid than losing wealth. The country has 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy, and losing one may inspire others to begin, or revive, separatist movements.

But there are many other unanswered questions, including continued membership in the European Union.

If forced to apply independently for EU membership, Catalonia would have to convince all of the bloc's current members, including Spain, to agree.

And if Catalonia became an independent state, it would not automatically be a World Trade Organization member, so would likely face stiff trade barriers that would hurt its economy.

Speaking on French TV Monday, Nathalie Loiseau, France's minister of European affairs, said the French government would not recognize an independent Catalonia.

If independence were to be recognized -- which is not something that's being discussed -- the most immediate consequence would be that (Catalonia) automatically left the European Union, said Loiseau.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría said in an interview on Spanish radio that the government would invoke powers to take control of the regional government if Catalonia went ahead and declared independence.",Catalans' future on line as parliament meets,https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/10/europe/catalonia-puigdemont-parliament-address/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,
